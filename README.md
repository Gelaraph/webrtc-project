## Editor setup

We're using eslint for js linting, and prettier for code formatting, make sure you install eslint and prettier plugins in your editor so you can
see linting errors as you code and have your code formatted on save by prettier. If formatOnSave doesn't work please google how to set up
format on save for the eslint & prettier plugins in your editor ðŸ™ƒ
